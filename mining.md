# Data mining

Data mining is the process of uncovering information within a dataset; it is also known as Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD). There are 2 data mining results that you can achieve – describing the data you have or making predictions for the future.

The 1st and maybe the most difficult step in data mining is setting the business objective. It is also the most critical. If you don’t know what you are looking for, it will be tough to select the Machine Learning ML types, algorithms, and models to get the information you need.

Data mining can help with sales and marketing, so that a company better understands its customers and marketing. Schools and universities can use it to better understand their students based on information like time spent in a virtual classroom, the number of keystrokes, the classes students took simultaneously, or which classes have more successful test scores.

Corporations can also use data mining to optimise operations by understanding manufacturing, assembly, faults, and failures, amongst many things. It is also beneficial for fraud detection. Banking can use data mining to look for the patterns of fraud or even the store that has been compromised.

The 2nd step is to prepare your data. If you understand your objective, your data scientists can determine the relevant dataset so that the resulting information is useful for your business. Data scientists must clean the data, duplications, missing information, and outliers within this second step. All of this could prevent your data mining algorithms and tools from delivering the results you need.

The 3rd step is to build the model and mine for patterns. This is where the techniques and tools below come in. Data mining could use deep learning algorithms with supervised or unsupervised learning methods.

The fourth and final step is to evaluate the results the data mining has produced to make changes or take actions that are beneficial to the business.

# Data mining techniques
Data mining techniques allow data scientists and businesses to make better use of large amounts of data. Some of the techniques include:

- Pattern tracking is a fundamental technique of identifying patterns, such as the increased sales of snow shovels when a storm is coming, for example. Except what you are looking for are things that are not so obvious.
- Classification is another technique that allows data to be put into different categories and assigned a classification. For example, you can classify bank customers based on their financial history as low, medium, or high-risk credit card customers.
- Association is another method related to pattern tracking. It looks for variables linked at specific moments. An example would be the realisation that a sauce choice will come next when a customer puts pasta into their shopping cart. Or that after the sauce, there will be parmesan cheese.
- Outlier detection is another method of data mining that looks for exceptions or anomalies. An example would be a massive spike in sales to female customers in a typically male store in June because, as it turns out, women shop for the fathers the week or two before Father's day.
- Clustering is another technique that is similar in nature to the classification technique. This time, data is grouped because of its similarity. Customers could be linked by shopping frequency or disposable income.
- Regression is the ability to predict a value based on values in the past. Regression looks for the average over time, because things like home prices will fluctuate a little high to a little low over time compared to the current average price.
- Prediction is a data mining technique that allows businesses to forecast a value in the future.

# Data mining tools
Data mining tools are essential to improving the effect data mining has on the productivity of the company. Some of the top tools out today are:

- MonkeyLearn
- RapidMiner Studio
- Sizense for Cloud Data Teams
- Alteryx Designer
- Qlik Sense
- Orange
 
**MonkeyLearn** is a text analysis tool. You can use it to detect sentiments like negative online reviews or automate your ticket tagging and routing processes.

**RapidMiner** Studio is an open-source platform that offers a drag-and-drop interface that allows non-programmers to customise their use case. It can be used for fraud detection or customer turnover. For programmers, there are R and Python extensions that customise the data mining. There is also a terrific community for support.

**Sizense** for Cloud Data Teams allows teams to work together to extract intelligence from their data no matter the technical level of the team member.

**Alteryx** Designer makes it possible for a data analysts to prepare, blend, and analyse their data with one tool.  

**Qlik Sense** is a visualisation software tool with "stunning charts and graphs." It allows multiple data sources to be analysed with drag and drop functionality.

## How Is Data Mining Done?
Data mining is accomplished by implementing several steps that ensure collected data is accurate and usable within a specific context.

There are five steps data analysts use to successfully perform data mining:

1. **Research:** Conduct business research to get an understanding of enterprise objectives, resources that may be utilized and ongoing scenarios to set an effective data mining plan.
2. **Data Quality Check:** Next comes data quality checks, which evaluate and match the data collected from multiple sources to avoid bottlenecks in integration and detect any anomalies before mining.
3. **Cleaning Data:** Data is then cleaned to remove corrupt or inaccurate entries from the data set.
4. **Data Transformation:** Data transformation is the next step in preparing data to be slotted into the final data sets and includes data smoothing, data summary, data generalization, data normalization and data attribute construction sub-processes.
5. **Data Modeling:** Finally, data modeling is used to identify data patterns through the use of mathematical models.

## Data Mining Examples
- Mining customer data to determine buying habits and which products with which to target them
- Mining claims data to detect potential insurance fraud
- Determining the average wear and tear of production items in manufacturing based on previous orders and repair data 

## How Does Data Mining Work?
Though the name evokes images of a miner digging for ore, data mining doesn’t focus on the dig. Instead, a data miner’s responsibilities revolve around analyzing that ore (i.e., the data) to predict its value or detect useful patterns within it. This process may seem complex, but it is not as difficult as it sounds, and the skills it encapsulates can greatly benefit those looking to become data scientists.

Because of the volume and differing types of data we create daily, assessing and determining their relationships can be difficult and time-consuming. How, for instance, can a florist use daily sales totals, online searches for their store, and comments on the store’s Facebook page to determine which flowers to order? Data mining can provide an answer.

To do their jobs, data mining experts have to know how to collect and store data, work with databases, and extract the proper data from them. Further, data mining requires knowledge of industry problems and the data that will help solve them.

Ultimately, organizations in every industry — from government and finance, to healthcare and technology — have questions to answer and projections to make. For this reason, data mining often begins with a question.

For example: How many flowers should a florist order prior to a major event?

Through data mining, the florist can assess past sales, check what customers are searching for online, gauge their interests through social media posts, and make projections based on the success of other recent events during the year. Asking the right questions, and collecting the right data to answer those questions, is critical to successful data mining.

## Business Understanding
This is the starting point. What questions do you have? What do you want to learn from your data? Companies and organizations first must identify their objectives, including what insights they want to extract or problems they want to solve using their collected data. Determining project goals is important for collecting the right data to be analyzed.

## Data Understanding
Once the objective is defined, it’s time to define the data. Not every data point stored on a server or in the cloud is appropriate for every project. Determining the right data to be sourced saves time and the potential hassle of retracing steps later.

In this phase, data is collected from multiple sources based on the problem being addressed. Is the company looking for historical sales of a certain item? The type of credit card used to make a purchase? Whether items were bought in store or online? Each type of data may be relevant — or not — depending on the project.

This part of the process is important for verifying data quality as well. Missing, errant, or duplicate data can be corrected before moving to the next phase.

## Data Preparation
Data preparation is considered the most demanding phase of data mining, often consuming at least half of the project’s time and effort. It’s in this step that the most helpful data is selected, cleaned, and sorted to account for errors or coding inconsistencies. Data from multiple sources can be merged, organized, or adjusted in different ways to prepare for the next phase: modeling.

## Modeling
Now the data begins to take shape. Data miners can run a variety of models (ways of organizing data) to generate solutions. For instance, models can seek to detect patterns or anomalies in the data or use the data to predict an outcome. Companies will choose the model based on the type of data they’re analyzing, the project’s specific requirements, and the goals being pursued.

Several modeling techniques can be used on the same set of data to derive different results. Rarely do companies answer their data mining question with just one model.

## Evaluation
At this point, data miners assess whether the models have produced a satisfactory answer to the question asked and whether the results contain any unexpected or unique findings.

If the initial question remains unanswered, a new model might be required, or the data might need to be changed. If the results meet their criteria, the project moves to its final phase.

## Deployment
At this point, companies have answered the question they asked. In the flower shop example, perhaps the model suggested an increased order due to past sales and expected customer demand. The florist can deploy that knowledge to ensure they have enough flowers on hand when a major event arrives.
