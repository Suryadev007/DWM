# Ind Vs Aus Ist Match 

Eighty-seven minutes of madness was all it took for Australia's promising hopes of reclaiming the Border Gavaskar Trophy to turn to dust in Delhi.

A day that started with the visitors holding the edge over India with a 62-run head-start and a strong belief they were within touching distance of leveling the series, ended in the early afternoon with India recording their second three-day win in a fortnight.

It was all made possible by familiar spin tormentors Ravindra Jadeja and Ravichandran Ashwin, who bowled unchanged on Sunday morning as they engineered an extraordinary collapse of 8-28 in just 74 balls.

The scale and speed of Australiaâ€™s implosion was barely fathomable.
